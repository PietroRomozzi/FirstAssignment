First Assignment:

Last week we created this repository to upload our fisrt assignment. Giulia Minnucci was added as a collaborator to better work together.

This week we work with R using two datasets and illustrating some basic distributionts relevant to the data by using simple descriptive statistics.
We linked the files, so sourceP.R runs datawomen.R

Moreover, a pull request has been accepted by another group so the changes made by them are now merged with our codes

> Style guide: We use Hadley WickhamÂ´s Style Guide from [r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html).
